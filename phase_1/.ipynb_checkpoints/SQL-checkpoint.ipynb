    "## Terminology \n",
    "- **Relational Database** -  a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another(SQLite, MySQL(typically used in web application development), Postgres)\n",
    "- **Non-relational Database** - (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form\n",
    "    - **4 Major types:** \n",
    "        - **Document DBs** - stores data in documents similar to JSON objects(MongoDB) \n",
    "        - **Key/Value** - Useful for large databases that don’t need complex querying(Redis/DyanoDB)\n",
    "        - **Wide-column** - Flexible b/c each row doesn’t need to have the same columns. Good for storing IOT/User profile data(Cassandra)\n",
    "        - **Graph dbs** - good for pattern searches on social networks, fraud detection, recommendation systems - Neo4j \n",
    "- **Primary KEY** (like a DataFrame index), each table has one with a unique index for each row in the database. The name of the primary key is typically preceded by an asterix (\\*).\n",
    "- **Foreign KEY** - a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Used to prevent actions that would destroy table links\n",
    "- **Rows** - Sometimes referred to as _records_. \n",
    "- **Columns** - Sometimes referred to as _fields_.\n",
    "- **Schema** - Shows the structure of the database and how the tables are related to each other \n",
    "- **Char/Varchar** - string characters and variable length characters\n",
    "- **One to One Relationship** - Typically used for security reasons - like a customers table and a personal information table. \n",
    "- **One to Many** - Most common relationship. \n",
    "    - Customers can make many orders.\n",
    "    - Orders can contain many items.\n",
    "    - Items can have short and long descriptions .\n",
    "- **Many to Many** - Usually two one-to-many relationships with a table linking the two relationships.\n",
    "    - each order can contain multiple items. And each item can also be in multiple orders."
