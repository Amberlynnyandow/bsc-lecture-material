You really only can calculate probabilities within an interval for a continuous variable. While a lot of individuals may have a weight of approximately 120 pounds, the probability of having a weight of exactly 120 pounds is zero.

    "Because sample statistics are imperfect representations of the true population values, it is often appropriate to state these estimates with confidence intervals.\n",
    "#### Key Ideas \n",
    "- Sample statistics are supplemented with confidence intervals to approximate the population\n",
    "- Generally believe sample statistic is in the neighborhood of true population's statistic\n",
    "- The larger the sample, the less likely we got all the \"weirdo\" data points from the population\n",
    "- We trade certainty with precision by expanding our interval\n",
    "- Taking multiple samples (experiments) allows us more examples of where the true population statistic lies\n",

    "#### Interpreting Confidence Intervals \n",
    "**Wrong:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a 95% probability that the mean age is between 26.3 and 28.3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we find 100 (random) samples and create confidence intervals, we expect 95 intervals would contain the true mean of population age.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are confident in this interval because we expect that a true population mean outside of this interval would produce these results 5% or less of the time. In other words, only an unlikely (but not impossible) sampling event could have caused us to calculate this interval, if the true mean is outside of this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true population mean is a specific value and we do not know what it is. The confidence level you choose is a question of how often you are willing to find an interval that does not include the true population mean, but it doesn't tell you whether this particular sample + interval calculation gave you the \"right\" answer."
