    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is the process through which the null hypothesis is accepted or rejected. Where the goal is to make a decision about the value of a population parameter based on the sample data.\n",
    "_Note:_ A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about a _population parameter_. There two types of statistical hypothesis: _null($H_o$) and alternative hypotheses($H_a$)_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry - do inputs from two different barley fields produce different yields?<br/>\n",
    "Astrophysics - do star systems with near-orbiting gas giants have hotter stars?<br/>\n",
    "Economics - demography, surveys, etc.<br/>\n",
    "Medicine - BMI vs. Hypertension, etc.<br/>\n",
    "Business - which ad is more effective given engagement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a large dataset for a population. The data is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along comes a new sample with a sample mean of 2.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind hypothesis testing is a desire to quantify our belief as to whether our sample of observations came from the same population as the original dataset. To formalize this intuition, we define a threshold value for deciding whether we believe that the sample is from the same underlying population or not. This threshold is $\\alpha$, the significance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as the foundation for hypothesis testing where we will reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "_Note:_ We never accept the alternative hypothesis. We ONLY reject OR fail to reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When are one-sample z-tests used?\n",
    "The one-sample z-test is used when you want to know if your sample comes from a particular population. The one-sample z-test is used only for tests related to the sample mean."
