We're in luck cause there are 39 of us. According to the CLT we could take repeated samples(with replacement) of the persons in this room and get those _sample means_; plot them and then take the mean of those sample means. That sample means _mean_ should be very close to the actual population mean. Some means will be higher and lower due to chance. "
